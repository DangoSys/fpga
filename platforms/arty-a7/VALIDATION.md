# Validation record

Verified on 2026-10-09 for **Arty A7-100T**, part `xc7a100tcsg324-1`.
These results cover RTL simulation and FPGA implementation. Physical JTAG
programming, USB UART operation and board acceptance remain untested.

## Reproducibility

The build exports 264 unchanged Buckyball source files from commit
`1f3d54535bd5fb76d5fd2f6b05ed36e591cf3097`, checking each SHA-256 against
`UPSTREAM_MANIFEST.json`. All five dependencies were exported from the commits
in `dependencies.json`. The verified build used local Git objects for the
Buckyball baseline and freshly downloaded dependency snapshots.

After moving this platform into the FPGA repository, a fresh checkout with an
uninitialized Buckyball submodule successfully fetched the baseline into its
private cache and verified all 264 source files and five dependency exports.
The host tests passed again. Hardware, firmware, Scala and simulation sources
are byte-identical to the implementation tested above; only source discovery
and repository documentation changed. The existing K7 platform and shared
Buckyball submodule revision were preserved.

Tools: Vivado 2024.1 (implementation), Vivado XSim 2025.1 (interface tests),
Verilator 5.050, RISC-V GCC 13.2.0, Java 17, sbt 1.12.11, Scala 2.13.16,
Chisel 6.7.0 and firtool 1.62.1. The firmware compiler is selected with
`RISCV_PREFIX`; different compiler versions can produce different firmware.

| Artifact | SHA-256 |
|---|---|
| Original Chisel output, `PebbleA7Chip.emitted.txt` | `54af3762e65b35e39367f8cbecc96298f11da54d923d54f79b739867470c65db` |
| Packaged RTL, `PebbleA7Chip.sv` | `51908c47eafa5dbf0cfe1004c86dee50331be081e6d716ae0f387a67ad3289a9` |
| Resident firmware, `demo.bin` (2440 bytes) | `5a9f143857c418d689d7e9bd0be2997ebf5a0812329aa6ffddd1c99d337d6df7` |

Removing the unused FireSim `targetutils` build dependency produced identical
RTL. No upstream CPU, DMA or operator implementation was modified.

## Functional checks

- Four XSim suites passed: AXI BRAM, AXI UART, UART receiver and serial loader.
  They exercise bursts, byte strobes, backpressure, malformed requests,
  FIFO handling, CRC/range errors and reset recovery.
- Four Python host protocol tests passed, including fragmented replies,
  sequence wrap, a known CRC vector, and invalid response rejection.
- Full-system Verilator simulation passed in **1,724,701 clock cycles**:
  cold resident boot before any upload; serial firmware upload and readback;
  CPU RAM/MMIO checks; DMA and original custom instructions for SMatMul,
  MatAdd and ReLU; UART echo; a second input seed; and reset/reboot.
  Assertions were enabled. Only DPI/diagnostic printing was disabled.
  The simulation uses 16 clocks per UART bit to reduce runtime; this cycle
  count is a test duration, not an accelerator performance benchmark.
- Black, Flake8, LLVM clang-format, Scalafmt, Verible, EOF, whitespace,
  conflict-marker and file-size checks passed via the installed hook tools.
  The pre-commit wrapper could not finish fetching hook repositories through
  the server's proxy; this is not recorded as a successful pre-commit run.

## Routed implementation

The complete top-level design passed synthesis, placement, routing and
`write_bitstream`. No DSP-forcing attributes or alternative mapping experiment
were used. DSP usage below is for the whole chip, not a count of SMatMul PEs.

| Metric | Measured result |
|---|---:|
| Core clock | 50 MHz (20 ns), from the 100 MHz board oscillator |
| Slice LUTs | 43,405 / 63,400 (68.46%) |
| Slice registers | 24,253 / 126,800 (19.13%) |
| Block RAM | 65.5 / 135 tiles (63 RAMB36 + 5 RAMB18) |
| DSP48E1 | 12 / 240 |
| Setup WNS / TNS | +1.004 ns / 0 ns |
| Hold WHS / THS | +0.018 ns / 0 ns |
| Pulse-width slack | +3.000 ns |
| DRC | 0 errors, 17 DSP pipeline performance warnings |
| CDC | 3 safe crossings; 0 unsafe/unknown crossings |

`audit_routed.tcl` passed: correct part, all nine package pins and LVCMOS33
standards, 50 MHz generated clock, and no latches or blackboxes. Timing
exceptions cover asynchronous input synchronizers, MMCM-lock reset assertion,
and asynchronous LED/UART outputs; they do not validate external board wiring.

The implementation scripts retain timing, utilization, routing, DRC, CDC and
I/O reports under `build/arty/`. Generated binaries and checkpoints are excluded
from Git. The recorded tests are evidence for this configuration, not exhaustive
ISA, protocol, workload-size or silicon validation.
